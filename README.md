# MACHINE LEARNING - SPRING 2020 - FINAL PROJECT

## American Sign Language Character Classification

**Project Due: April 17, 2020, 11:59 pm (report and code) and April 20/22, 2020, 10:40 am (presentation)**

In the final project, you will develop a method to classify American Sign Language (ASL) characters. You can implement this yourselves or using a package/library. You can use any packages that come as a default option with Anaconda or Pytorch. *I need to be able to run your implementation on my machine. So, be sure to get approval from me for any special packages! If I cannot run the code, you will lose a significant number of points.*

You may work in groups of no more than 4 individuals.
